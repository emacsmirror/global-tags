== global.el

=== Purpose

* Provide a (unit-) testeable Emacs Lisp API that wraps `global` binary calls (exposed to developer).
* Optional integration to Emacs using aformentioned API with `project.el` and `xref.el` (exposed to final user).

=== Secondary purposes

* Integrate to main Emacs branch
* Do *not* expose `global` to the final user with commands: user should use `project.el` and `xref.el` functions
