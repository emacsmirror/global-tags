== global.el

=== Purpose

* Provide a (unit-) testeable Emacs Lisp API that wraps `global` binary calls (exposed to developer).
* Optional integration to Emacs using aformentioned API with `project.el` and `xref.el` (exposed to final user).

=== Secondary purposes

* Integrate to main Emacs branch
* Do *not* expose `global` to the final user with commands: user should use `project.el` and `xref.el` functions
* Improve response times of queries in remote or big codebase by pre-fetching results in the background.
* Prevent Emacs from freezing when calling global. While `global` is meant to respond real quickly, calling it using Tramp can freeze Emacs for a few seconds.

=== Features

* Navigate files using project.el
* Navigate tags for current files with Imenu
* Search for tags using xref
* Do-what-I-mean: search either a symbol under cursor or header file under cursor (inside a `#include`)
* Pre-fetch results (list files, list tags, database location) for a snappier experience.

=== Usage

You can setup using GNU global as backend with any of the following two lines:

[source,elisp]
----
;; to use GNU Global automagically, regardless of Emacs default configuration
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook #'global-tags-exclusive-backend-mode)
;; to use GNU Global automagically, respecting other backends
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook #'global-tags-shared-backend-mode)
;; configure Imenu
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook #'global-tags-imenu-mode)
----

Alternatively, you can manually configure project.el and xref.el, add their
"recognize this global handled project" to the proper places like so:

[source,elisp]
----
;; xref (finding definitions, references)
(add-to-list 'xref-backend-functions 'global-tags-xref-backend)
;; project.el (finding files)
(add-to-list 'project-find-functions 'global-tags-try-project-root)
;; to update database after save
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda ()
                           (add-hook 'after-save-hook
                                     #'global-tags-update-database-with-buffer
                                     nil
                                     t)))
----
